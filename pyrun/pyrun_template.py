# PyRun bootloader for #$pyrun (based on Python #$version)
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This template is used by makepyrun.py to build the bootloader
# script for PyRun.
#
# It uses these placeholders (all prefixed with "#$", which are filled
# in with the appropriate data by makepyrun.py:
#
# * pyrun    - name of the pyrun executable
# * version  - version of the pyrun executable (the supported Python version)
# * release  - pyrun release version
# * imports  - imports generated by makepyrun.py, so that freeze.py
#              can find all needed modules to include in the
#              pyrun executable
#
# Compatible to Python 2.7 and 3.4+
